        <h2>Intro to Coding</h2><!--Code history-->
         <p>After a couple years of managing a warehouse for a Bay Are production company, I realized it as not the career path for me.
          I quit my job and traveled for several months contemplating what i wanted to do with my life.  However, nothing seemd right.</p>

      <p>For the next year and a half i bounced from temp job to temp job.  Nothing fell into a career.  My current job could be made into a careerhowever it is not something I am passionate about.  
          My girlfriend has worked in the tech industry for several years in San Francisco and urged me to give coding a try.  To be honest I was nervous
          and had doubts that I could learn to code.  After about 9  months of "pressure", I finally took my frist steps to coding.  I was wasting time sitting at home during the Corona Virus quaratine 
          so i thought it would be the perfect time to give coding the old college try.
